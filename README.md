CV / Resume generator

I created this application to to test and practice my knowledge of props and state in React. The user form takes the information and stores it in the useState, which is passed into the Render-CV component through props. CSS styling needs some cleanup.

## WIP
Next features will be rendering the resume section into a printable or savable PDF file for use.
